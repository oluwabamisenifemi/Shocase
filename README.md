Hatchmanager: a secure collaboration platform. (implemented using Django)




HatchManager is a simple implementation of a comcept of a platform that aims to replace youtube's feautures that allows
youtube channels give video upload functionality to freelancers and employees to upload in their absence.
It focuses on ensuring security through features like:
Two-Factor Authentication
Logging of all activities
A robust Notification system
 
On this platform, youtubers can create hatches linked to their google account, using Google's Oauth thechnology
and create 'hatches' linked to the email of another individual to give others access to upload videos on their youtube channel
without fear of security concerns.

'Hatches':
Hatches are simply created by the channel owner and using the freelancer's email and the functionality gets made available to the
freelancer
